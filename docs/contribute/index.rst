Contributor's Guide
===================

This guide helps you either contribute to HARP or extend it by writing applications.

This guide will guide you through the journey of either **contributing to HARP**, or **extending it** by writing your
applications. Both topics are covered together because the plugin-based architecture makes it quite similar. This is our
way to create a limit-less system: whatever can be done in the core system can be done in a userland application. And
most of harp core features are actually implemented as applications.

This guide will help you either contribute to HARP Proxy or extend it by writing your own applications. Most core
features of HARP are implemented as such, making your own applications as powerful as the core ones.

You can also contribute to HARP without writing code: send feedback, proofread documentation, join `discussions
<https://github.com/msqd/harp/discussions>` on GitHub, report issues, sponsor the project, or suggest new features.

Don't hesitate to `reach out <https://harp-proxy.net/contact>`_ to us!

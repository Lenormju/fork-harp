Contributor Guide
=================

This guide will help you either contribute to HARP Proxy or extend it by writing your own applications. Most core
features of HARP are implemented as such, making your own applications as powerful as the core ones.

You can also contribute to HARP without writing code: send feedback, proofread documentation, join `discussions
<https://github.com/msqd/harp/discussions>`_ on GitHub, report issues, sponsor the project, or suggest new features.

Don't hesitate to `reach out <https://harp-proxy.net/contact>`_ to us!

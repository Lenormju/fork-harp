Contributor's Guide
===================

This guide will guide you through the journey of either **contributing to HARP**, or **extending it** by writing your
applications. Both topics are grouped here together because the plugin-based architecture makes it quite similar. This
is our way to create a limit-less system: whatever can be done in the core system can be done in a userland application.

Harp development (either for internals or new applications) heavily depends on containers, you should have a working
docker environment first.

Although this guide is mostly written to help you contributing code (or extending the system for your own needs), you
can also contribute to HARP in many code-less ways: sending feedback, proof-reading documentation, `opening or
contributing to discussions on github <https://github.com/msqd/harp/discussions>`_, reporting issues, sponsoring the
project or specific features (subject to core-team approval), etc.

Don't hesitate to `reach out <https://harp-proxy.net/contact>`_ to us if you want to help but do not know how.

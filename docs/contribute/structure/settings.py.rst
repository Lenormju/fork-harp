settings.py (optional, convention)
==================================

The ``settings`` module generaly holds whatever is required to configure an application, from the end-user perspective.

This is a convention, and could be named anything else (but please, don't).

We usually use dataclasses to write configuration objects, please look at other builtin applications for examples (a
better documentation will be written later, but for now reading the examples should give enough informations).

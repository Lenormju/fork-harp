Python & PIP
============

Harp is also installable using a python package manager (most probably, `pip`).

You need a working python 3.12 envionmane, with the `pip` package manager (or another package manager of your choice).

To insall it, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install harp-proxy

Then, you'll be able to start the server using:

.. code-block:: bash

    harp server
